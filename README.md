CIFUDE ( Create Insert Fetch Update Delete Extras ) is a powerShell wrapper around Azure Table Storage methods. They are based on a SQL Server Schema as far as table names, column names and column types go. 

The powerShell scripts contains information to recreate the SQL Server schema in Azure Table Storage, and parameters to quickly Insert, Fetch, Update and Delete rows.

The scripts are created by SQL2X, an 10 year old engine originally created to simplify WCF development and WinForm creation. Later this fall SQL2X will be made public for users to quickly turn their Azure SQL Server databases into Azure Table Storage databases as far as the schema goes. The differences between these two data storage technologies are many though, so this is just meant to be a quick an dirty method meant to help developers choose wish one fits their needs.
